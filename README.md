# The Advantages and Disadvantages of Using GitHub
October 19, 2016/in Blog /by Reade

Web-savvy folks have probably heard all about (and most likely use) GitHub, a repository hosting service for Git that also has a web-based graphical interface. The service includes access controls as well as a number of collaboration features like tools for basic task management and wikis for all projects you handle. It’s definitely something worth looking into, and the best way for you to say if it is the one service to use is by knowing its advantages and disadvantages.

# Benefit 1: Github makes for easier contributions to your top open source projects.

Almost all open source projects utilize GitHub for project management, mainly because it’s free and includes nifty features like wikis and issue trackers for better documentation and feedback. Users not only enjoy easier project management, but they also get to accept contributions that come in from the community. If you are part of this community and would like to issue a contribution, you just need to fork the project, input your changes, then have it sent back with a pull request via GitHub’s web interface.

# Benefit 2: GitHub has everything turned into Markdown.

Basically, Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents. GitHub has revolutionized writing by channeling everything through Markdown: from the issue tracker, user comments, wikis – everything. With so many other programming languages to learn for setting up projects, it’s really a big benefit to have your content inputted in a format without having to learn yet another system. In addition, there is also what is known as the GitHub flavored markdown – a feature that adds changes to the usual markdown in order to make it more useful in programming environments.

# Benefit 3: GitHub has some of the best documentation around.

You won’t run out of content when you use GitHub, thanks to a well-padded guide and help section for articles that you can pull up for practically any topic on earth, for as long as it is related to a git. It’s got content for helping you learn about generating SSH keys. A guide for the best git workflow is available. Samples on gitignore (and more) are abound for your next planned project, among other things. You would not need to look elsewhere for all the information that you need.

# Benefit 4: GitHub has Gists and GitHub Pages, too.

A while back, GitHub rolled out a feature called Gists, which lets you convert one or several files into a working git repository. This new feature converted sharing and tracking changes made to configuration files and even simple scripts into a whole new level of easy. While they aren’t as rich in features like a full-blown GitHub repository, they really work well even if you are without a paid account. GitHub pages, on the other hand, lets you host static websites by simple assigning HTML pages onto another, separate repository – the way you would any other type of git repository. With this, blogging can be done off the bat as well as updating with additional documentation or bumping up its web presence.

# Drawback of GitHub

To many, GitHub might seem like the best thing since sliced bread. In reality, like all things it also has its fair share of criticisms and concerns, no matter how small it may be. For some people, the design of Git leans more towards the programmers – which means it may not communicate very well in layman’s terms. So basically, there’s a bit of a learning curve expected – but once you get to know its pros and cons, you’ll find that it really is quite easy to use!
